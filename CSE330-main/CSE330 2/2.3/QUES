Given a N x M grid. Find All possible paths from top left to bottom right.From each cell you can either move only to right or down.

Example 1:

Input: 1 2 3
       4 5 6
Output: 1 4 5 6
        1 2 5 6 
        1 2 3 6
Explanation: We can see that there are 3 
paths from the cell (0,0) to (1,2).
Example 2:

Input: 1 2
       3 4
Output: 1 2 4
        1 3 4
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findAllPossiblePaths() which takes two integers n,m and grid[][]  as input parameters and returns all possible paths from the top left cell to bottom right cell in a 2d array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(2^N*M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 <= n,m <= 10 
1 <= grid[i][j] <= n*m
n * m < 20
