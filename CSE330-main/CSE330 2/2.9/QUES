Problem
Consider a series  that is defined as follows:

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
For n >= 3, 
Given two integers n and m. We need to make the  term and  term of the series co-prime. Find the largest positive number by which we must divide the  term and  term of the series such both terms become co-prime. Since, this number can be very large, print it modulo .

Note: Two numbers are said to be co-prime if there does not exist any number greater than 1, which divides both the numbers.

Input format

The first line contains an integer  denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains a string denoting the integer .
The second line contains an integer .
Output format

For each test case in a new line, find the required largest positive number modulo .
